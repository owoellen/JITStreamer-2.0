# JITStreamer-2.0
This is a JIT Enabler for iOS 17.4+ over VPN (Wi-Fi only) or over Local Network / USB

## Requirements
- A Mac, Linux or Windows Computer (You can also do this with a Server but a host computer is needed to pair your device)
- A VPN such as [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (Wireguard based VPNs are the only ones that have been tested)
- Python 3.10+ (with pip / pip3 installed)
- `git` (on Windows you can get it [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows))


## Setup


Open Terminal (on Windows Administrator Powershell) and run these commands (not the ones with the #)
```
# Setup venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate venv 

# macOS / Linux
. ./venv/bin/activate

# Windows but using Powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Windows but using Command Prompt/CMD 
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.bat

# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/stossy11/JITStreamer-2.0.git

# cd into directory
cd JITStreamer-2.0

# Install JITStreamer
pip3 install -U -e .
(if that doesnt work try pip install -U -e . )
```



## How to use JITStreamer?
- Make sure your device is connected to a computer.
- You will need the IP of your Server / Computer from the VPN
- JITStreamer will need to be installed on that computer (if you are using a server you still need JITStreamer installed on your computer)

**Jitterbugpair pairing files are not supported**

First you will need to get the pairing file from JITStreamer. 
**This will need to be run on your host computer as your device needs to be plugged in**
``` 
# Run this (in the terminal from before)
JITStreamer --pair

# macOS
open ~/.pymobiledevice3/ 
```
on Windows you will need to go to your user folder and find the .pymobiledevice3 folder

You should now find the file that should be a .plist file (example: 00001111-000A1100A11101A.plist ignore the _remote plist file) 

Send this file to your iDevice over AirDrop or Emailing it to yourself (Please compress the file before sending it to your iDevice)

Now you will need to connect to the VPN from before (Number 2 in Requirements) and download this shortcut on your phone:
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a463b0f216cc445f8d0e5f355a7e7666

The UDID of your device will be the name of your pairing file and the address will be the IP of your server with http:// in front (example: "http://100.97.35.58")
You will need to input your Pairing file into the shortcut.

You will need to now launch JITStreamer on your server or Computer (make sure you are connected to the VPN on both your Server / Computer and iDevice)
```
# macOS / Linux
sudo JITStreamer

# Windows (make sure you are in an Administrator Powershell or CMD Window
JITStreamer
```

Now Run the Shortcut and you will need to press the "Upload Your Pairing File" Button and then when it's done it should say `{"OK":"File uploaded"}`

Finally run the shortcut again and Enable JIT (the first time may take a while as it would be mounting your Personalised Disk Image)

### How to use JITStreamer with Docker

This is somewhat still a work in progress, but it has been tested and works as its currently made. Improvements like a smaller image, less privileges and maybe even a compose file to include a vpn server are planned as TODO.

Make sure port 8080 is free first; then you can get the container with:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}/:/root/.pymobiledevice3/ -v /var/run:/var/run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --network=host ghcr.io/stossy11/jitstreamer-2.0@latest --pair
```

In the directory you've started this command you'll find your .plist file as well as another directory JITStreamer uses. Best to not remove those but copy the .plist to you're device (and copy it's name while you're at it).

Once you've gone through the shortcut and got it working, you can close by doing: CTRL + C. Your container gets cleaned up but you can start it in the background and on boot this time by using:

```bash
docker run -d --restart=always -v ${PWD}/:/root/.pymobiledevice3/ -v /var/run:/var/run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --network=host ghcr.io/stossy11/jitstreamer-2.0@latest
```
